  HOW-TO.TXT    A guide to writing adventure games using Archetype.
                Along with BARE.ACH, describes the both beginner and
                advanced adventure features which you can implement
                with this system.
  HOW-TO.RTF    The Rich Text Format version of the guide.

  MANUAL.TXT    The complete Archetype reference manual.  Details
                the constructs of the language itself rather than
                the overall picture; read it later, not first.
                It is written for people who have never compiled
                a program before so don't let your intelligence
                be insulted.
  MANUAL.RTF    The Rich Text Format version of the manual.

Games:
  STARSHIP.ACX  The Starship Solitaire adventure.  Hidden objective -
                you've got to play it to find out what you have to do!
                Awakened from suspended animation, alone on a starship,
                the fate of the slumbering crew depends on you.

  GORREVEN.ACX  The Gorreven Papers.  To think of them was unspeakable;
                to speak of them was unthinkable.  They're in the wrong
                hands, and you, intrepid agent that you are, went after
                them.  But something went wrong and now you're their
                prisoner!  Escape with the Gorreven Papers -
                and your life, if you can.

  BARE.ACX      A demo adventure; very simple, no objective.  Source code,
                BARE.ACH, is included.

  ANIMAL.ACX    The old Animal game (computer tries to guess what animal
                you're thinking of), implemented using Archetype.  Source code,
                ANIMAL.ACH, is included, as well as a data file, ANIMAL.DAT,
                containing the memory of a few games played with it.

Programs:
  CREATE.EXE    The Archetype translator.  Invoke with no arguments for
                a listing of available options.
  PERFORM.EXE   The Archetype interpreter.  Requires .ACX files generated
                by the translator.

Archetype files:
  STANDARD.ACH  Included by an Archetype program in order to operate as
                a standard text adventure.
  INTRPTR.ACH   Included by STANDARD.ACH .  The adventure interpreter.
  LEIXCON.ACH   Included by STANDARD.ACH .  The base lexicon.
  CARDINAL.ACH  Included by STANDARD.ACH .  The cardinal directions of the
                                            compass.

  UTILITY.ACH   A set of utility types that may be useful.
  DEBUG.ACH     Include for easier debugging (remember to CREATE
                with the /D switch).

  BARE.ACH      A bare-bones adventure showing off popular features and
                explaining how to implement them.
  BARER.ACH     The same bare-bones adventure without the comments, so
                as to see the flow of the code.

  ANIMAL.ACH    An interesting implementation of the old favorite computer
                game, "Animal", where the computer guesses what animal
                you're thinking of by asking yes-or-no questions.  When
                you stump it, you teach it.  Saves "data" by taking
                advantage of the Archetype "save game state" feature.
